# 02Challenge
In this challenge i edited the source code to raise the site to accesibility stadards. By changing vague tags like <div> to more specific tags like <header> or <main>. Also adding alt tags to images will help with accesibility when images wont load. Also making sure the structure of the html page follow logical structure before styling.
